An app created as part of an interview

I didn't finish the full CRUD functionality during the interview and decided to complete it.

Use the info in example.properties to create your application.properties in the same location. Make sure to update your MySQL username and password to 
work with your server.

Use the SQL table seeder found in the SQL Seeder folder to populate the two tables. It is set to use a database named appddiction_db. If you do no have Hibernate set to create the databse automatically, you can use the database creation script to create that for you. You can manually add data as well and at a minimum you will need an admin user in order to login.

The seeder's default admin username is: jtest and password is: Password1
